## What is Engo?

- Engo is a custom rule engine that parses rules defined in its specific language I call, `Engolang`. It helps define rules and validate users against these rules. 
- Engo supports representations like `ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees)` and `DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)` to optimize rule processing.
- The UI, built using **React Flow**, allows interactive visualizations of these rule structures. üåü

| Represents the syntax of a rule. It is commonly used in compilers for code analysis. Compiler first creates a parse tree (Concrete Syntax Tree) which is converted to an Syntax tree (Abstract Syntax). | Represents a compressed form of an AST. In large-scale applications with complex expressions, DAGs significantly reduce memory usage and eliminate redundant computations. |


## Engo's Tokenizer

A code-snippet from Engo's Tokenizer. Can parse numbers, attributes, functions (custom user-defined), left and right parantheses, comma andlogical operator in order of precedence (AND, OR, NOT).

```python
token_specification = [
    ('NUMBER', r'-?\d+(\.\d+)?'),   # Integer or decimal number, including negatives
    ('STRING',   r"'[^']*'"),       # String enclosed in single quotes
    ('AND',      r'\bAND\b'),       # Logical AND
    ('OR',       r'\bOR\b'),        # Logical OR
    ('NOT',      r'\bNOT\b'),       # Logical NOT
    ('FUNCTION', r'\b\w+\s*\('),    # Function names followed by '('
    ('COMMA',    r','),             # Comma
    ('OP',       r'(<=|>=|<>|!=|=|<|>)'), # Comparison operators
    ('LPAREN',   r'\('),            # Left parenthesis
    ('RPAREN',   r'\)'),            # Right parenthesis
    ('IDENT',    r'\b\w+\b'),       # Identifiers
    ('SKIP',     r'[ \t]+'),        # Skip spaces and tabs
    ('MISMATCH', r'.'),             # Any other character
]
```
